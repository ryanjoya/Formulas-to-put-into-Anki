Dijkstra's Algorithm
DOWNLOAD Mathematica Notebook
An algorithm for finding a graph geodesic, i.e., the shortest path between two graph vertices in a graph. It functions by constructing a shortest-path tree from the initial vertex to every other vertex in the graph. The algorithm is implemented as Dijkstra[g] in the Mathematica package Combinatorica` .

The worst-case running time for the Dijkstra algorithm on a graph with n nodes and m edges is O(n^2) because it allows for directed cycles. It even finds the shortest paths from a source node s to all other nodes in the graph. This is basically  O(n^2) for node selection and O(m) for distance updates. While O(n^2) is the best possible complexity for dense graphs, the complexity can be improved significantly for sparse graphs.

With slight modifications, Dijkstra's algorithm can be used as a reverse algorithm that maintains minimum spanning trees for the sink node. With further modifications, it can be extended to become bidirectional.

The bottleneck in Dijkstra's algorithm is node selection. However, using Dial's implementation, this can be significantly improved for sparse graphs.
